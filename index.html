				<h1> About out story </h1>
				<img id="about_image" src="../images/aboutUs.jpg" alt ="A hand holding potted plant">
				<p id="aboutText">The Garden Shop's story starts in 2007 when we began retailing plants from a small corner of the Habitat Furniture Store on Grafton Street, Dublin. From the very beginning, we were delighted with the interaction that customers had with our plants - the 'wow isn't that amazing' factor! What better job than to talk about your passions and have someone share it with you. Since then, we have expanded our plant offerings and now work with both private and corporate clients nationwide. We garden in all sorts of wonderful plants, from magnificent outdoor specimens for the garden lover to health-enhancing indoor plants for the hours proud and frankly, everything in between too!</p>
